<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430210478">Pro Django</a> is a  book for developers who want to deepen their knowledge
of how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> works.</p>
<div class="section" id="content">
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>After the first chapter explains the fundamental <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/">design philosophies</a>,
the second chapter (&quot;Django is Python&quot;) explicates important Python techniques
the framework relies on. Metaclasses, Augmenting Functions or Descriptors are
some of them.</p>
<p>They are explained clearly and with a lot of understandable code examples.
Take Metaclasses for example. The book explains them by using Django's
declarative syntax as a sample. I find that by knowing how Django uses them
it's much easier to understand Metaclasses, as I now have a good practical
example to refer to.</p>
<p>The following chapters go into modules of the framework, which are &quot;Models&quot;,
&quot;URLs and Views&quot;, &quot;Forms&quot;, &quot;Templates&quot; and &quot;HTTP&quot;. The basics from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/">official documentation</a> are skipped or just briefly mentioned as this book
goes into more depth.</p>
<p>Parsing the content of a template is a good example for this. The book does
an excellent job explaining every single step of how a raw string is processed
through the Lexer and Parser to a set of Python objects that can be rendered.
I always wondered about nodes and tokens when writing template tags.
After reading the chapter about templates I finally understood the whole
process and can now think of even more possible uses.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 (&quot;Backend Protocols&quot;) describes Django's generic API for features
like databases, authentication or storage. By implementing the protocol of an
API it's easy to write backends that, for example, can enable Django to use
another database engine or use another storage backend (like <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>).</p>
<p>Next, the &quot;Common Tools&quot; chapter shows lesser known tools and features of
Django. It explains which core exception should be thrown in which situation,
the data structures which are available (MergeDict, MultiValueDict, SortedDict)
and other interesting things which help keeping the code consistent and easier
to maintain.</p>
<p>The last two chapters &quot;Coordinating Applications&quot; and &quot;Enhancing Applications&quot;
go step-by-step through the process of creating a Real Estate project and
enhancing it using the techniques described in this book. The latter chapter
made me realize how handy all the previously explained low level methods are
when developing reuseable 3rd party applications for Django. It enables a model
to keep historical records of its contents by adding just a single line to the
original application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I found this book to be a great read. I will keep it around as a
reference for further development and recommend it to every Django developer
who wants to take a look behind the scenes of Django.</p>
<p>Since the book was written for Django 1.0 I think that some people are holding
back on buying it because of the Django 1.1 release. But there's no need to
worry. Backwards-incompatible changes will not happen in the 1.x branch and
the API will remain stable until Django 2.0. This book should be safe to use
with every Django 1.x release.</p>
