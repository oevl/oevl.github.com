<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/django-1.0-template-design-practical-guide/book">The book</a> is a comprehensive and practical guide of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django's</a> template
system aimed at beginners. Even though the author expects some experience
with Django or Python I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. Knowledge
about data structures like Python dictionaries is explained along the way and
the template syntax is generally easy to understand. It should be noted though
that the book doesn’t include an installation guide. A working development
environment with Python and Django installed is required.</p>
<p>The writing style is clear and easily readable. There are also a lot of code
examples to make things clear. Even though the 11 chapters are mostly
structured around a follow-along example site it doesn’t need to be read
sequentially.
Especially the chapters at the end (Pagination, Internationalization, Cache)
can also be read independently of the others.</p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2009/jul/21/rc/">Django 1.1 around the corner</a> a book about version 1.0 of
the framework might seem a little outdated. But don’t worry, the API will
remain stable until Django 2.0.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book starts out by explaining the syntax of the template system and
illustrating how it fits into the big picture of handling requests in Django.
The following two chapters then go into more detail about how URLs are mapped
to views, views are structured and values are passed to the templates.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is a reference of all built-in Tags and Filters. The author decided
to include it because the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#ref-templates-builtins">online documentation</a> didn’t provide
examples of usage and syntax for all of them.</p>
<p>The next two chapters focus on template configuration, loading and inheritance.
After an explanation of template loaders and the idea behind the extends- and
block-tag the author goes on to show how alternative templates can be served
by using template overrides and custom Middleware.</p>
<p>Finally, there are chapters on pagination, customizing the admin, caching and
internationalization. Except for the, very detailed, pagination chapter the
other don't go into as much depth as the online documentation but nonetheless
provide a good overview of the basics. For example, the chapter about
Internationalization only shows how strings in templates can be marked as
translatable and message files can be generated. It still doesn’t go into
as much depth as the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/#topics-i18n">online documentation about i18n</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="verdict">
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the book is missing a chapter about Forms. Most people dealing
with templates in Django will at one point or another also want to work
with Forms, so this would’ve been a good addition.</p>
<p>With that said, I’d recommend the book for web designers who are working with
the template layer but have little or no experience with Django. It doesn’t go
into much depth but covers enough topics to give the reader a good
understanding of Django in general.</p>
