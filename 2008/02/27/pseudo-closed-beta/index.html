    <p>Web2.0 services spring up like mushrooms nowadays, most users can't even keep up anymore. In order to stand out from the crowd, services are now going the way of <em>pseudo closed beta</em>.</p>

<p>Do you know these pesky letters which land in your mailbox from time to time, and claim that you were selected to take part in some special lottery? Yeah, I bet you love them as much as I do - a <em>pseudo closed beta</em> is like that.</p>

<p>Instead of sending you spam mails, which will be ignored anyways, new services give away a bunch of invites to tech weblogs that promise to write about the service. For other users, there's a form on the website in which you can enter your email address and, <em>if you're lucky</em>, get an invite code.</p>

<p>But here's the trick: <strong>Everyone gets an invite</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometime later an email arrives with the invite code in it: This must be your lucky day - you immediately fire up your browser, register and start testing everything out thoroughly.</p>

<p>From the web service's standpoint, the advantages are simple:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Users <em>focus</em> on various features and try <em>everything</em> out.</li>
	<li>If something's wrong, they fill out a <em>bug report</em>.</li>
	<li>Many users trying everything out equals an<em> active community</em>, which attracts other users to join.</li>
	<li>Users <em>blog</em> about the service, giving their readers an "insight-look".</li>
</ul>
<p>But would you care that much if it were a <strong>open beta</strong>?</p>
