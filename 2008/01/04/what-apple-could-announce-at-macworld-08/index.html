    <p>There's still some time left before January 15th, the day Steve Jobs kicks off the Macworld Expo with his keynote. As always before a MacWorld, Apple users are blogging and speculating about what Apple might release. Here's my take on it.</p>

<h3>MacBook mini</h3>
<p>The most rumored product to ship at this years MacWorld is a 12" ultra-portable MacBook, which analysts also call "MacBook mini" or "MacBook slim" (although I don't really think Apple will call it "slim" - such a name can only come from analysts). The new sub-notebook won't have a internal optical drive, just an external one and the hard drive will eventually be replaced by a faster and quieter solid-state drive.</p>

<h3>iMac-like Docking Station &amp; Apple Cinema Displays</h3>
<p>Current Apple Cinema Displays are still using the same over 2-year-old technology, an update is long overdue.
Along with the new Cinema Display's, there might be a new iMac-like docking station announced which will let you integrate your MacBook (mini) in it. Apple already <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=20080002350&amp;OS=20080002350&amp;RS=20080002350">filed a patent</a> for such a docking docking station in July 2006 - more than half a year later Apple could present it at the MacWorld.</p>

<h3>High-Definition Strategy: Blu-Ray</h3>
<p>Apple will likely announce their strategy for high-definition content and go with Blu-Ray. Blu-Ray drives might be available as an upgrade to new Mac Pros and also as an new external blu-ray drive, which will hopefully not only work with the new MacBook Minis.</p>

<h3>iTunes &amp; Apple TV</h3>
<p>It's already mostly confirmed that Apple will offer movie rentals over iTunes but there might also be an update for the Apple TV which will enable it to purchase and rent content directly via iTunes, a feature for which you currently have to use your PC.
Also rumored is a complete new device instead of a software update. The "Apple TV 2" will most likely feature a larger hard drive and come with a blu-ray drive.</p>

<p>Finally, the Beatles might be available on iTunes. The rumor has been around since last year and with two special guests (which are still unknown) announced, it might happen.</p>
