    <p>Today I'd like to bring up the history of one of my favourite applications: <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is a Open-Source bittorrent client which was primarily developed for Mac OS X. After now almost three years in development, main developer John Clay decided to release the final version 1.0. The PHP based web interface <a href="http://clutchbt.com/">Clutch</a> was also updated to be compatible with the new release.</p>

<p>In the past, Transmisson has had it's problems with many popular bittorrent trackers blocking specific versions of the client mostly due to tracker hammering. Users had to fight with failed hash checks and also the corruption of already completed files but with some help from the <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/community.php">community</a> and on-time updates the problems were fixed.</p>

<p>However, even with all tracker problems resolved users were still using the feature richer <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> - but even that changed over time. With the implementation of encryption, prioritization and selective downloading most users switched completely over to Transmission.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, more and more former <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> users are now going over to lightweight alternatives available on their operating system. With Transmission for OS X, <a href="http://deluge-torrent.org/">Deluge</a> for Linux and <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">uTorrent</a> for Windows the bittorrent client is slowly losing its user base.</p>
