    <p>Ever since <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> introduced flash messages, it has become a widely popular feature which got ported to various other frameworks such as <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/06-Inside-the-Controller-Layer#Flash%20Attributes">Symfony</a> and is also available as a custom <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/tags/flash/">middleware for Django</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash.html">RoR API documentation describes a flash</a> as a:</p>

<blockquote>"… way to pass temporary objects between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts …"</blockquote>

<p>However, many developers tend to use it for more than just <em>"doing notices and alerts"</em>, like passing  critical variables. This might not be a functional idea in the day and age of Tabbed Browsing since request variables like <strong>flash attributes are set browser-wide</strong>, each new tab on the same controller causes the flash value to be overwritten.</p>

<p>Meaning that if you have 5 tabs opened and each tab points to the same page (but has different request variables) the same flash attribute gets overwritten multiple times. <strong>The flash value from the most recent opened tab is used for all 5 tabs</strong>. If the next action of your application relies on that specific flash attribute, it might produce some unexpected results.</p>

<h3>Example: A Blog</h3>
<p>Think of a simple blog which shows a listing of various entries on the frontpage. With a click on an entry, it simply gets shown with a comment form. The <em>entry id</em> for the comment form is passed via a flash rather than a hidden field.</p>

<p>If the user opens up multiple blog entries from the frontpage in new tabs, each tab sets the <em>entry id</em> flash again. When the first tab gets opened, the flash attribute has the value of the last opened entry - a written comment would be associated with the last opened entry rather than the first opened entry.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Sticking to hidden fields and validating it's value properly might (still) be the best idea.</p>
