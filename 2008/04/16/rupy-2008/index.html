    <p>Last weekend I attended the RuPy (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/">Python</a>) conference in Poznan
(Poland).</p>
<p>The program was splitted into simultaneously held Ruby and Python talks. For
example: while the &quot;TDD in Rails&quot; talk in room A, a &quot;TDD in Python&quot; talk was
held in room B. Language-independent talks, like &quot;Business Natural
Languages&quot;, were held in one room.</p>
<div class="section" id="talks">
<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>I missed half of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">Micheal Foord's</a> talk on &quot;Programming the Browser with
IronPython and Silverlight&quot; due to my late arriving. However, the stuff which
I saw gave me some nice insights into what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>
are capable of.</p>
<p>Watching the adoption of Silverlight and development of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a>
(Silverlight for linux) is quite interesting, especially since Microsoft made
a deal to <a class="reference external" href="http://visitmix.com/blogs/News/477/">put Silverlight on the official Beijing Olympics website</a>.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/rupy2008/">rupy2008 tag</a>)</p>
<p>The next talk by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> about &quot;Correlations and Conclusions&quot; was really
funny but also very informative. He benchmarked <a class="reference external" href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> against
<a class="reference external" href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> and inserted the data into <a class="reference external" href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. R seems like really nice tool for
statistical data and once you get used to it's weird syntax there are
certainly a lot of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>What I didn't know was that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a> is more superior to <a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">ab</a> and used for
serious stuff, while ab is mostly okay for quick'n'dirty benchmarks.</p>
<p>The presentation itself was done using latex-beamer and generated out of a
YAML file - a quite interesting concept which Zed Shaw is going to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/index.html">describe
further in his blog</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://tartley.com/">Jonathan Hartley</a>, who works together with Micheal Foord at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.resolversystems.com/">Resolver
Systems</a>, held a great talk about Test-driven development and shared his
experiences over the past few years. A really interesting fact is the ratio
of test code to product, which is 4:1 - meaning that there are four lines of
test code for each line of product code.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://bnl.jayfields.com/">Business Natural Languages</a> (a Domain Specific Language for empowering
subject matter experts) were presented by <a class="reference external" href="http://jayfields.com/">Jay Fields</a> from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>.
The whole point in a BNL is to allow the customer to change the applications
behaviour without involving the developer. It's definitely worth a look for
some bigger projects.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>The organization was perfect and the chosen topics very interesting. The only
negative thing was actually lunch, which was horrible (and not very warm).</p>
<p>However, it was a great conference which I can only highly recommend to
everyone interested.</p>
