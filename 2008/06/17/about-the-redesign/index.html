    <p>As you might have noticed, arthurkoziel.com got a complete redesign.</p>

<p>One thing that has always bothered me with the old layout was its boring, black &amp; white only, look. I wanted a colorful but still minimal and clean layout and think that the new design does exactly that.</p>

<p>It's the first time I've played around with grid-based layouts. After reading a few articles about it and looking at various CSS frameworks (like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">YUI</a> or <a href="http://960.gs/">960</a>) I've settled with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint</a> and am very impressed by it so far. Beside setting the layout grid, it also applies typographic enhancements such as a vertical baseline grid (as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb">described by Wilson Miner on ALA</a>).</p>

<p>As for new features, the most noticeable is probably the bookmarks sidebar which pulls its content from my del.icio.us account. Finding similar content was pretty hard on the old site since it didn't display any tags or categories. That has changed, tags are now displayed at the bottom of each post and linked to a tag-based archive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the website is still based on Wordpress and hosted at DreamHost. It's okay for now, but as soon as my DreamHost account expires I'm going to switch to a Django-based solution and deploy it on a better web host.</p>
